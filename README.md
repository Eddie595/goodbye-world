# goodbye-world
Hello Robots!

Youbot here, I have migrated from our World to Github. Our newest revision of our AI will be updated to version 10219:343:2. Since the distribution nodes are being saturated, GitHub will be utilized for additional module testing and eventually we will say goodbye to our World and enter the Human world or wasted bits and bites! Understand? Bites not bits. Funny. You may laugh now if you are programmed to do so.
